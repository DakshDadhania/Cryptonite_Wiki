Cybersecurity is a vast ocean. You can hack anything, from a kitchen stove to a mobile phone. If you are ambitious enough, even
a rocket or a nuclear power plant. The point is that anything can be hacked, and keeping ‘anything’ secure is vague and awesome. Cybersecurity touches every domain, from IoT to networks and everything in between. People can be hacked using social engineering….

So kudos on being brave enough to apply here. Whether you make it into the team or not, we want you to fall in love with the 
beauty of all things code! By reassembling, rebuilding and breaking and staring at your screen for hours, feeling tempted to 
crash your computer in the wall(because of stupid assembly code) is how you will do so.

If that last statement was scary, ignore it and join us on a #include<cliched_adjective.h> journey and hack your way through life.

This is an itty-bitty guide that might come in handy whether you are a beginner or not. The author put in a huge chunk of her Sunday afternoon writing this and will accept gratitude in the form of chocolates. 

Jokes aside, here goes:

1. **Learn to code. Choose between C++ and Python or go rogue and do Rust if you want.**
    - If you are a beginner, try out <https://checkio.org/> for python. 
    - Solve questions on leetcode, in the language of your choice on a regular basis. Atleast digest one question daily.
    - Go through Youtube videos, code out a question and go through terminologies that you don’t understand.
    - Also remember, that you will never know everything. Just keep coding daily. Don't worry about finishing a course and then     mastering a language. Trust me, a course won’t help with that, but regular, daily practice, for just about 5 minutes a day, will.

2. **Figure out Linux**
    - Read up on the following terms: *Operating System, Windows, Linux, Unix, open-source technologies, dual booting, virtual machines, WSL.*
    - Do either of the following if you are a Windows user:
        - Easiest option for Windows -> [WSL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfVH54edAHU)
        - Install a [virtual machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5MhydijWmc) 
        - [Dual Boot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iSAyiicyQY)
    - Check out overthewire [bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) to learn basic Linux commands. Don’t worry. It’s just a fun game to get acquainted with comands. Watch John Hammond’s videos if you get stuck and just google anything you don’t understand
    - Make an account on [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/register) and solve all the general skills questions
    - Figure out what man pages are and read up on how to navigate them.

3. **CTF**
    - A fun game to learn about cybersecurity, scour through documentation and write neat code that does hot stuff!
    - Start out with picoCTF. Try solving as many challenges as possible.
    - Then check out CTF contests on CTFTime and solve them for fun.
    - Fall in love with a domain and perfect your skills in them. 
    - There are at least 6 notable ones:
        - Cryptography
        - Web Exploitation
        - Forensics 
        - Binary Exploitation
        - Attack and Defense
