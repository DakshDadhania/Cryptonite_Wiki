## **What is Attack and Defense CTF?**

Attack and Defense CTF is a type of CTF where contending teams look for security flaws in the services run by the opposition teams.
Each side seeks to identify weaknesses in the services of the opposing team while defending its own, hence the term "attack/defense".

Once a team finds a vulnerability in the service that they're running, the team should exploit it on their own server(s) while simultaneously patching the hole on the servers of the opposing team(s).

Attack and Defense CTFs are similar to *Penetration testing*.

## **Penetration Testing**

**What is Penetration Testing?**

A penetration test, simulates a cyberattack on your computer system to look for weaknesses that could be exploited.
Insights provided by the penetration test can be used to patch detected vulnerabilities.

**Types of Penetration Testing**

1. **Network Penetration Testing**<br />
    Network Penetration Testing searches for vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure such as firewalls, serves and switches.

2. **Web Application Penetration Testing**<br />
    Network Penetration Testing finds vulnerabilities in Web-applications. It is a 3-step process:<br />
    1. **Reconnaissance :** Finding information about the Web-applications such as the servers being used, operating system,       services, etc.<br />
    2. **Discovery :** Finding the vulnerability in the application and planning the attack vector to be used.<br />
    3. **Attack :** Exploiting the vulnerability to gain unautherized access.

3. **Wireless Penetration Testing**<br />
    Wireless penetration testing is used to identify risks associated with Wireless communications services.

4. **Physical Penetration Testing**<br />
    Physical penetration testing can assist in protecting an organization's physical assets from threats such credential cloning, tailgating and social engineering. 

5. **Social Engineering Penetration Testing**<br />
    Users are a prominent target for attackers and are frequently seen as the weakest link in the security chain. Social engineering penetration testing focuses on the organization's people, processes, and security vulnerabilities.

6. **Client-Side Penetration Testing**<br />
    Software operating on client machines, such as web browsers, media players, and content creation software suites, may have security flaws that can be found via client-side penetration testing techniques.
